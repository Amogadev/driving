## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to reflect trust and competence. Noe: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Background color: Very light greenish-blue (#E0F8F7), providing a soft and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted olive green (#808000), complementing the primary teal with a natural feel, for optional highlights and subtle calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and easily readable user interface.
- Use simple, clear icons for form fields and navigation, in a style aligned with road safety.
- Clean, organized layout with clear section headings and labels to guide the user through the form. Use a grid system to maintain consistency and alignment.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., form submission success).
