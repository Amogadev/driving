/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a driving school application.
 * All user-specific data is nested under a user's private document tree, and access is
 * controlled by the user's unique ID present in the document path.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Users have complete control over their own data. They can create their user profile and
 * manage their own related subcollections (like applicant details and document details).
 * Access by any other user is strictly forbidden.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: A user's primary profile document.
 * - /users/{userId}/applicant_details/{applicantDetailsId}: Private details for a user's application.
 * - /users/{userId}/llr_document_details/{llrDocumentDetailsId}: Private documents for a user's application.
 * - /llr_applications/{applicationId}: A top-level collection for all LLR applications.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only ever access documents within their own `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - User Listing: All authenticated users can list all users, but cannot write to other users' profiles.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The `/llr_applications` collection requires each document to contain an `applicantId` field. This denormalized field is used to grant ownership-based permissions without needing slow, cross-collection lookups. This allows for secure and performant rules.
 * - Default Deny: Any operation not explicitly granted is denied.
